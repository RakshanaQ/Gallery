        <h1>Q.FATIM RAKSHANA SILVERA</h1>
        
        <p> <h4>I'm Rakshana from Virapandianpatnam. I completed my schooling at St. Joseph’s School (CBSE) in Virapandianpatnam, securing 87% in my 10th grade and 65% in my 12th grade. I was a math-biology student. Currently, I’m pursuing a BCA degree at the FacePrep campus of Kamaraj College in Thoothukudi.<br> On the positive side, I’m confident in my ability to communicate effectively. On the other hand, I sometimes hesitate to ask for help, which I’m actively working to improve.<br>                    I’m proud to share that my friend Subha and I participated in a paper presentation event called Techno Talk. It was an intercollege competition and our first presentation. Despite competing against second- and final-year students, we won the prize. It was a thrilling and inspiring experience.<br>Additionally, my friend Ramya and I recently participated in a symposium and secured 1st place in Tech Hunt, which was another great learning experience.
<br>I’ve also had the opportunity to give reviews about Microsoft courses to other departments. During this, our vice principal and HOD visited, and I took the initiative to encourage other departments to open Microsoft accounts and utilize its resources.<br>In the long term, my dream is to become an entrepreneur. I aspire to build something meaningful that makes a difference and creates opportunities for others. My short-term goal is to become a full-stack developer.</h4>
